# CodeIgniter #
--------


## What is this? ##
--------

This is a basic CodeIgniter Project Template that I use every time I need to start a new project. It has all of the basic features I usually need when building apps with CodeIgniter.

## Why should I use this? ##
--------

If you build apps with CodeIgniter and you often find yourself in need of authenticating users, organize your application logic into modules or tired of loading view files from within view files, then I think you will like this template.

## How do I use this? ##
--------

* Clone this repository
* Create a new database, user and password and import the doc/project_database.sql file into the new database.
* Edit application/config/database.php and update the database name, user and password
* Edit application/config/config.php and make sure to update the following settings: base_url, admin_url (you can remove index.php if you're using a .htaccess file), encryption_key, sess_cookie_name, csrf_token_name and csrf_cookie_name
* The app should be up and running by now
* New controllers on your app should inherit from App_Controller
